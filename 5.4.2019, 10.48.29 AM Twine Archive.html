You decide that you should probably leave things alone. You watch the waitress slowly become more flirty with the guy as the night goes on. You know that he&#39;ll eventually break her heart and that she&#39;s too good for him. It&#39;s pretty depressing to watch, but there&#39;s not really much you can do.

The barkeep yells at him &quot;You&#39;ve had enough tonight, why don&#39;t you get back home.&quot;
